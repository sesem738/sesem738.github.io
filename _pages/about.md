I am a PhD Candidate in the Dynamics, Control and Robotics Lab at Florida Insitute of Technology under the supervision of [Dr. Kim-Doang Nguyen](https://www.fit.edu/faculty-profiles/n/nguyen-kim-doang/). My research primarily revolves around advancing robot control in partially observable scenarios through deep reinforcement learning. Additionally, I am actively engaged in research related to engineering education, where we investigate how the facets of data proficiency influence student motivation and the development of an engineering identity.

My current fascination revolves around Embodied AI and the realm of Human-Robot Interaction. My goal is to build robots capable of providing invaluable assistance to humans in all facets of their daily lives.
