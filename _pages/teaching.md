### Florida Institute of Technology
**MEE 4630 / 5630 -- [Modeling Dynamic Systems](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/intro-to-robotics/): Fall 2022**<br>
_Instructor_<br>
Studies theoretical, experimental and computer methods for characterizing dynamic behavior of various physical systems. Includes generalized approaches between mechanical, electrical, fluid and thermal systems

**MEE 3024 -- [Computer-Aided Engineering](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/intro-to-robotics/): Summer 2023**<br>
_Instructor_<br>
Students generate finite element models from solid geometries, defining load, boundary and constraint conditions, characterizing material properties and optimizing performances. Uses computer models to perform stress, stability and dynamic analysis of mechanical components and assemblies
