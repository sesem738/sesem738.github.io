# Raspberry Pi-Powered DJI Robomaster S1 Robots

Welcome to our project page where we showcase our innovative work in transforming DJI Robomaster S1 robots into powerful machines with Raspberry Pi at their core. We've taken these robots to a whole new level, enhancing their capabilities and functionalities. Let's delve into the details of our project:

## Project Overview

Our project aimed to elevate the DJI Robomaster S1 robots by upgrading their hardware and implementing advanced software solutions to make them more versatile and adaptable for various applications. Here's a brief overview of what we accomplished:

### Hardware Modification

One of the foundational aspects of our project was the hardware modification. We replaced the stock processing units of the DJI Robomaster S1 robots with Raspberry Pi, providing a significant boost in processing power and flexibility.

### Custom 3D Printed Structures

To accommodate the Raspberry Pi and ensure a seamless integration, we designed and 3D printed custom structures for the robots. These structures not only house the Raspberry Pi but also provide a stable platform for other components.

### Multi-Robot Coordination

We developed a Python application that allows multiple robots to synchronize their movements. This feature opens up a wide range of possibilities for collaborative tasks and multi-robot applications.

### Real-time Object Detection and Distance Measurement

Using Robot Operating System (ROS) and Python, we created a real-time object detection and distance measurement algorithm. This advanced capability enables the robots to perceive and interact with their environment intelligently.

### PID Controller Implementation

To ensure precise and controlled movements, we implemented a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller using C++. This controller optimizes the robots' motion and enhances their overall performance.

## Project Impact

Our project has far-reaching implications in the field of robotics and automation. By combining the DJI Robomaster S1's mechanical excellence with the computational power of Raspberry Pi and sophisticated software solutions, we've created a versatile platform capable of tackling a wide range of tasks.


## Conclusion

Our project showcases the potential of marrying hardware and software to create intelligent and adaptable robots. With the Raspberry Pi-powered DJI Robomaster S1 robots, we've taken a step closer to realizing the future of robotics, and we're excited to see where this technology will take us next.
