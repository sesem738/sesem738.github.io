# Resilience Analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms against Cyberattacks

**Duration:** November 2021 â€“ January 2022

In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the resilience of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms against cyberattacks. We focused on the application of DRL in autonomous driving scenarios and explored various aspects of algorithmic resilience.

## Project Highlights

### Autonomous Driving Agent

- **Activity**: Designed a self-driving agent using a Deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm to drive autonomously in CARLA simulation.
- **Description**: This agent demonstrated the potential of DRL in real-world applications, especially in autonomous driving scenarios.

### Sensor Data Processing

- **Activity**: Implemented and trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process vehicle sensor data, including LIDAR point cloud, RGB images, and semantic data.
- **Description**: These CNNs generated action-values (Q-values) that guided the agent's driving actions with precision.

### Behavior Planner

- **Activity**: Created a behavior planner for self-driving cars to handle common road scenarios and generate expert data for imitation learning.
- **Description**: This component ensured that our autonomous agent could navigate real-world scenarios effectively.

## Research Impact

Our project contributes to the growing field of autonomous driving and cybersecurity. By examining the resilience of DRL algorithms in the face of cyberattacks, we aim to enhance the security and robustness of autonomous systems, making them safer for real-world deployment.
