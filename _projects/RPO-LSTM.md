# Handling Partial Observability in Dynamic Systems with Deep Reinforcement Learning

**Duration:** January 2021 â€“ Present

In this ongoing project, we are focused on addressing the challenge of partial observability in dynamic systems using deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our work is at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and robotics, and we are making significant strides in this domain.

## Project Highlights

### Memory-Based Reinforcement Algorithm

One of the key achievements of this project is the development of a memory-based reinforcement learning algorithm. We have leveraged spatial-temporal transformers and implemented this algorithm using PyTorch. This innovation allows us to effectively handle scenarios where only partial observations of the environment are available. 

### Bridging Simulation and Reality

We are also actively involved in designing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm within NVIDIA Isaac Gym. Our goal is to facilitate the transfer of control policies learned in a simulated environment to a Tarot Octocopter in real-world settings. This transfer of knowledge from simulation to reality has the potential to revolutionize robotics and autonomous systems.

## Research Impact

Our research has significant implications for various applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. By tackling the challenges posed by partial observability, we aim to enhance the robustness and adaptability of AI-driven systems, making them more reliable in real-world, dynamic environments.

## Future Directions

As we continue our work, we are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. Our future endeavors may include:

- Fine-tuning our memory-based reinforcement algorithm for specific real-world applications.
- Expanding our research to address other challenges in the field of AI and robotics.
- Collaborating with industry partners to implement and deploy our solutions.
