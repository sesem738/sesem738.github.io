# Probabilistic Model-Based Framework for NAO Humanoid Robot Behavior in a Vinyl Maze Environment

In our ongoing project, we are developing a framework based on a probabilistic model to govern the behavior of the NAO humanoid robot within a controlled environment consisting of 20in Ã— 20in vinyl maze cells. NAO is recognized as one of the most advanced humanoid robots, equipped with advanced speech, vision, and artificial intelligence-driven behavior. This project aims to harness the potential of NAO's autonomous movement capabilities, which have been underutilized in existing software.

## Project Goals

Our primary objectives include:

- Creating a probabilistic model that characterizes the movement behavior of the NAO humanoid robot within the vinyl maze environment.
- Utilizing a public NAO sensor database to construct this probabilistic model, leveraging experimental measurements based on relevant environmental states.
- Developing a framework that allows for the integration of complex planners and reasoning mechanisms, including rich Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) models.

## Significance of the Probabilistic Model

The probabilistic model we are building offers several advantages:

- **High-Level AI Framework:** This framework enables the NAO robot to perform new tasks by specifying corresponding utilities, simplifying the process of extending NAO's capabilities.
- **Versatility:** The framework can adapt to various tasks and environments, making NAO more versatile and adaptable.
- **Data-Driven:** The model is based on experimental measurements and conditional probability tables derived from NAO sensors, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

## Testing and Future Work

We are currently testing the proposed model using a simple particle filter localizer on a predefined trajectory within the vinyl maze. Through testing, we aim to identify areas for improvement and data gaps in the NAO sensor database, which will inform our future work.

## Conclusion

Our project represents a significant step towards enhancing NAO's autonomous movement capabilities and leveraging its full potential for a wide range of applications. By developing a probabilistic model-based framework, we open the door to a new era of NAO's versatility and adaptability in various environments and tasks. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to advance this exciting research endeavor.
