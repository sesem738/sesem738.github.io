# Lionfish Remediation Device

**Duration:** March 2018 â€“ April 2019

**Project Type:** Capstone Project

In our Capstone Project, we undertook the development of a Lionfish Remediation Device (RID) to address the invasive lionfish species in aquatic ecosystems. Our project encompassed several significant aspects:

## Device Design and Construction

- **Objective**: Designed and constructed a specialized device for capturing lionfish.
- **Description**: We engineered a device capable of efficiently capturing lionfish, an invasive species known to threaten local marine environments. The device aimed to mitigate their impact on native aquatic life.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Training

- **Objective**: Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of various lionfish species.
- **Description**: Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a CNN capable of identifying different lionfish species. This technology plays a crucial role in automating the detection process and ensuring the accurate capture of invasive lionfish.

## Stress Test Analysis

- **Objective**: Performed stress test analysis on the RID device using ANSYS.
- **Description**: To ensure the durability and reliability of our lionfish remediation device, we conducted a comprehensive stress test analysis using ANSYS software. This analysis helped us identify and address potential weaknesses in the device's design.

## Project Impact

Our Lionfish Remediation Device project contributes to the preservation of aquatic ecosystems by combating the invasive lionfish species. By combining innovative technology with effective capture methods, we aim to protect native marine life from the detrimental effects of lionfish predation.

## Future Directions

As our Capstone Project laid the foundation for lionfish remediation, there are several potential avenues for future development:

- Scaling up the production and deployment of RID devices to combat lionfish invasions on a larger scale.
- Continued refinement of the CNN for enhanced lionfish species detection accuracy.
- Collaborations with environmental organizations and agencies to implement our solution in real-world scenarios.
