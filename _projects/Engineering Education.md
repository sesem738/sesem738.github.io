# Research Project: Investigating the Relationship Between Data Proficiency, Motivation, and Engineering Identity Among Undergraduate Engineering Students

In this research project, we conducted a comprehensive mixed-methods study to explore the intricate connections among data proficiency, motivation, and engineering identity among undergraduate engineering students. Our goal was to gain a deeper understanding of how these variables interact and influence one another within the context of engineering education.

## Research Methods

### Data Collection

We employed a mixed-methods approach to gather data from a diverse sample of undergraduate engineering students. Our data collection methods included surveys, interviews, and self-reporting measures to capture both quantitative and qualitative data.

### Data Analysis

To extract meaningful insights from our data, we utilized a variety of analytical techniques:

- **Thematic Coding:** Qualitative data, such as interview transcripts and open-ended survey responses, were subjected to thematic coding. This process involved identifying recurring themes, patterns, and narratives within the data.

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Quantitative data collected through surveys were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis. This allowed us to summarize and present key findings in a quantitative format.

- **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):** We employed SEM to examine the complex relationships among data proficiency, motivation, and engineering identity. This powerful statistical technique helped us develop and test a theoretical model that explains the interplay between these variables.

## Collaborative Approach

Our research project was a collaborative effort that benefited from the expertise and guidance of a faculty mentor from Penn State. This collaborative partnership played a crucial role in shaping the research plan, refining our methodology, and providing valuable feedback throughout the project's duration.

## Research Impact

Our research project contributes significantly to the field of engineering education by shedding light on the factors that influence the development of engineering identity among undergraduate students. By understanding how data proficiency and motivation interact in this context, we hope to inform educational practices and interventions that can enhance the educational experience and outcomes of future engineering professionals.
